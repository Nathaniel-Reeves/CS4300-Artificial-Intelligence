# CS 4300 Artificial Intelligence
This code was written as part of an Artificial Intelligence course at Utah Tech University. This repository includes each of the assignments and my class final project. A description of each assignment and my class project is included in this readme.

## Mountain Car
This was a test assignment to ensure this course's development environment was set up correctly.  Throughout the course, we used Gymnasium and Pettingzoo.

## Lunar Reflex
In this assignment, we practiced making several AIs that could play a simple lunar lander game.  The purpose was to get our feet wet in the Gymnasium environment as well as provide a discussion around the definition of AI.

## Taxi Model Search
This assignment introduced the concepts of reinforcement learning.  We used algorithms like breadth-first search to build an agent cabible of driving a simple taxi.

## Multiroom Search
This assignment introduced the class to A star Search.  We used a variation of A star to move a marker through a multi-roomed maze.

## Cliff Policy Local Search
This assignment introduced the class to the idea of policy space.  We discussed all the possible policies that could help an agent reach the goal and how we might create algorithms that would find the best policy.

## Adversarial Connect Four
Up to this point, our class has only worked in single-agent scenarios using Gymnasium.  This assignment expanded on the ideas from the previous assignments and how they may be used in a multi-agent environment.  We learned about Mini-Max algorithms and used what we learned to build a capable Connect Four agent.

## Class Project
The remaining half of the semester was dedicated to our class projects.  I have always been upsessed with Spider Solitare ever since I was first introduced to computers.  I thought it would be fun to create an AI that could play spider solitare for me (esspecially because I an not great at the game).

For the assignment, we built both the environment and all the agents that would work in said environment.  We were required to use the same format as Gymnasium or Pettingzoo so future students could test out our environments.

In the end, I did make an agent that could solve a very specific set of single-suit spider solitaire games.  This was a fun challenge and expanded my understanding of how AI and AI development work.
